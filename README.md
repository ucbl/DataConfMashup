DataConfMashup
==============


DataConf takes advantage of Linked Data for enriching conference metadata from several sources. 
It dynamically constructs complex SPARQL queries, sends them to cross-domain endpoints and allows users to browse these metadata using either a textual or a graphical interface.
For this, it relies on a main conference publication dataset. Since 2006, such datasets are available on the SWDF  SPARQL endpoint. These datasets mainly rely on the SWC vocabulary, thus integrating FOAF, SWRC or iCal elements.
